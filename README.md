# Detection using-deep-learning
this repo contain some classic object detection nets implement with pytorch and tensorflow

first is the **SSD** modle train and val on VOC2007 dataset, for the detail about the module, you can check this link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf  
during writing the code, **amdegroot/ssd.pytorch** and **kuangliu/pytorch-ssd** really help me a lot

i use VOC2007 trainval + VOC2012 trainval to train the network and test on VOC2007 testset
here are some test image result
